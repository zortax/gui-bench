//! The frameworks under test: each one is an app in `apps/<name>` with its own build. An app
//! shows one scenario per run, which the command line names. An edition of a framework is another
//! build of the same sources: `dioxus-skia` builds `apps/dioxus` with the `skia` feature into
//! `target/skia`; `gpui-kit-fast` and `freya-056a5b4` need dependency versions that cannot share
//! a lock file with their framework, so each is its own app directory whose `src` links to the
//! framework's sources.
